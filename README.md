# Tiffin-Service-Provider
designed to bring organization to the local tiffin and food services sector, which is often scattered and unorganized. By collecting and curating data on local tiffin service providers (TSPs), the app provides users with a wide range of options for homemade meal subscriptions. 
The primary problem addressed by "My Tiffin" is the lack of an organized platform for finding
and subscribing to local tiffin services. Many TSPs operate locally and rely heavily on offline
marketing, making it difficult for users to discover these services and find a variety of options.
This gap leaves a significant demand from students, office-goers, and others who seek convenient
access to home-cooked meals.
The app incorporates several unique features that distinguish it from traditional food delivery
services:
● A subscription model for weekly and monthly meal plans, tailored to users’ needs.
● The ability for users to view reviews, compare pricing, and explore diverse menus.
● A royalty-based revenue model, where a small fee (e.g., 2%) is charged on each
subscription, with the remainder passed on to the TSP.
● Integrated UPI payment for seamless and secure online transactions.
